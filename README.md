# NaturalGasForecasting

Analyzed past data and applied Linear Regression Microsoft Excel to predict Natural Gas Demand and Shortfall in Pakistan for the next 10 years 

Then usage sectors of natural gas in Pakistan were analyzed and a multi-criteria decision method was employed to identify which sector has alternatives and 
is not critical to the economy of Pakistan. Hence recommended that the transport sector should not be supplied with natural gas and instead should use alternative
like diesel and petrol to meet the supply. In this way, we could use the current natural gas resources in the best possible way and conserve it
until we find other reserves of natural gas.
